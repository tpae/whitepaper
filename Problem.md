## Limited edition Sneakers Market

The resale market for sneakers is massive â€” [$6 Billion](https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/08/dan-gilbert-and-campless-founder-launch-a-marketplace-for-sneakers/) global secondary sneaker market 1), fragmented, inefficient and lacks a single source of truth for the transparent and verifiable authenticity of such goods leading to rampant forgery.

As a result participants are forced to rely on profit motivated centralized services to provide authentication and exchange of such goods that charge high fees. eBay, the largest player charges 20% for its authentication service alone and in general the avg resale fee for sneakers is about 18%. Further, the fastest growing  and most reliable marketplace operator StockX has an authentication bottleneck, requiring all products to be sent to its facilities in the United States and also struggles with a cross border multi-currency payment barriers problem thus is not offering its services  to international sellers which alone account for $3.8 Billion annually.
