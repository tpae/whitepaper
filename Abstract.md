## The Decentralized Exchange for Things

Whoslux is a blockchain powered authentication service and decentralized secondary market for buying and selling limited edition, high demand goods such as collectible sneakers & luxury handbags ('authentic goods').

The resale market for authentic goods is massive, fragmented and lacks a single source of truth for the transparent and verifiable authenticity of such goods leading to rampant forgery. As a result participants are forced to rely on profit motivated centralized services to provide authentication and exchange of such goods that charge high fees (avg resale fee ~18%).

As a solution, Whoslux is creating an open decentralized network marketplace utilizing a utility token to drive participation and value, where product authentication is done purely online, secured and verified on the blockchain as a non-fungible token (NFT)with instantaneous peer to peer transferability. This model significantly reduces the cost to authenticate a product, spreads the profits to authenticator participants and maintainers across the network, aligns interests based on reputation and opens up participation across borders.

The vision of Whoslux is to create a truly liquid market for valuable goods by ensuring that all limited luxury items are authenticated and validated, priced accordingly to the market supply & demand and open to everyone.

Like StockX, weâ€™re creating a stock market of things, but way more efficient and open. Starting with limited release high demand deadstock sneakers.
