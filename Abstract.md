# Abstract

## The Decentralized Exchange for Things

Whoslux is a blockchain powered authentication service and decentralized secondary market for buying and selling limited edition, high demand goods such as collectible sneakers & luxury handbags ('authentic goods').

The resale market for authentic goods is massive, fragmented and lacks a single source of truth for the transparent and verifiable authenticity of such goods leading to rampant forgery. As a result participants are forced to rely on profit motivated centralized services to provide authentication and exchange of such goods that charge high fees (average resale fee ~18%).

As a solution, Whoslux is creating an open decentralized network marketplace utilizing a utility token to drive participation and value, where product authentication can be done online, secured and verified on the blockchain as a non-fungible token with instantaneous peer to peer transferability. Authenticated products will be associated with Tag ID (patent pending), which provides tamperproof Near Field Communication (NFC) authenticated product verification. This model significantly reduces the cost to authenticate a product, spreads the profits to authenticator participants and maintainers across the network, aligns interests based on reputation and opens up participation across borders.

The vision of Whoslux is to create a truly liquid market for valuable goods by ensuring that all limited luxury items are authenticated and validated, priced accordingly to the market supply & demand and open to everyone.
