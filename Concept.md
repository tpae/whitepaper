# Concept Definition

## Goods Authentication Blockchain

Credibility is critical to a well functioning marketplace for authentic goods where people need to be able easily verify authenticity of product before making a purchase.   

For the first time the blockchain enables us to create an immutable record that can be easily accessed by anyone from anywhere, and with the use of crypto currency we can enable commerce across borders and align incentives.

Idea is to make Whoslux the place where people virtually authenticate and cataloging their collection of sneakers while enabling them to buy and sell

Whoslux is a blockchain implementation that focuses on creating unique identifier for authenticated goods. Luxury goods, or any other authentic goods, are prone to forgery, and require "special attention" in identification.

This creates a middle market in the economy, where used luxury goods are sent to the authenticator intermediary company, where they validate and verify the goods before shipping them.

The markup is anywhere between 50%~80% depending on the supply and demand. This market alone is currently $120 Billion in the world.

Our primary concept used in our blockchain implementation utilizes a combination of Smart Contracts, and a RESTful interface to fit the growing demand of resale luxury economy.
