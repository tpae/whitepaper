Whoslux (Web/iOS/Android) App
---

Whoslux App will be broken down into four major sections.

  1. WLX Wallet
  2. Product Catalog
  3. Social Network
  4. Marketplace

## WLX Wallet
The app will have an interface to buy, sell, trade WLX tokens. The Wallet reflects the balance of WLX, which can be spent for trades and marketplace.

## Product Catalog
Product Catalog section is designed to help user authenticate, trade, and sell. The users can share their Catalog to other members, since they are public in the Blockchain.

## Social Network
Users can join our opt-in community, which links your catalog to your public profile. Our Social Network is ran and managed by Whoslux Team, for better usability and communication.

## Marketplace
Community members can participate in the Marketplace, which is a decentralized resale marketplace. The platform will be run as a Smart Contract, providing transparent rules. Trades can take place from the app, and will have trading interface.
